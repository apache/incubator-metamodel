  <comment>MetaModel is a library that encapsulates the differences and enhances 
		the capabilities of different datastores. Rich querying abilities are
		offered to datastores that do not otherwise support advanced querying
		and a unified view of the datastore structure is offered through a
		single model of the schemas, tables, columns and relationships. NO_M2ECLIPSE_SUPPORT: Project files created with the maven-eclipse-plugin are not supported in M2Eclipse.</comment>
